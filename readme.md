#Leveraging Transfer Learning to Enhance Real-Time Emotion Recognition

First model training code.ipynb must be run to train the models and export them in h5 and json formats to save model weights and architecture, each model must be trained seperately. The dataset used is FER2013 which can beb downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013. The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml contains haar features for facial detection. real time detection.ipynb contains the code for real time emotion recognition, all cells must be run to reproduce output. The relevant h5 and json files must be imported in this ipynb file to run.
